						My name is Wen Yao Chang, I am almost 22 years old. Grew up in Taiwan, and was raised by very fine parents.<br>
						I have one older sister, and she is currently working in China. She is 26 years old and is pretty.<br>
						My dad was a professional soldier and is retired now; my mom doesn't work because she already had a big trouble home---me<br>

						I have always wanted to come to United States to study. And my dream actually came true because of BYUI!<br>
						Volleyball has always been my favorite sport. I also like reading books in my free time.<br>
						There's probably only one food that I will never like to eat--- eggplant.<br>
						I wish one day I can become a successful Dad and businessman. I would love to establish a technology company.<br>
