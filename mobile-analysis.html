            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the task, we were asked to use our mobile devices to browse for 24 hours instead of using</p>
            <p>desktop or laptop. The purpose of this task is to help us having a better understanding of </p>
            <p>how it is like to browser in a tiny screen for a long time. I was able to pay more attention</p> 
            <p>on the sites that I have always been browsing and I did have different feelings about those sites.</p>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>Here are some of the example questions to help us know how the experiment went. </p>
            
            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>I can still pretty much see all the information that I wanna to see. </p>
            <p>However, for the website that I use the most -- BYUI I-Learn, I cannot see</p> 
            <p>the couse links but only the assignments. Sometimes I just want to view a</p> 
            <p>specific couse and the grade of it, without the tab, it's harder to gain</p> 
            <p>access to it.</p>
            
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>I am not sure what is the difference between question one and two. But here are my thoughts</p>
            <p>about this question. I think for most of the part, I can find everything I am looking for.</p>
            <p>Sometimes things might not be easy to find because there are limited spaces, but if you look</p>
            <p>hard and pay more attention, you should be able to find everying you wanna find.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>I am not sure if this was just my problem or a problem for everyone. I was going to cancel</p>
            <p>one of my orders from Amazon.com, but I cound't find the button to cancel it. I looked for it</p>
            <p>for a while and finally I gave up and went to the website and I was able to find it right</p>
            <p>away. Usually I can do most of the things on mobile devices, however, I do sometimes find out</p>
            <p>programmer forgot to put the same function when they design websites for mobile devices. </p>
            
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Definitely! Since the screen is so small, I have to keep scrolling down when I </p>
            <p>want to read a really long article. For example, I like to read news, and I found</p>
            <p>it extremely difficult when I want to read stories. Another thing bother me the </p>
            <p>most is that I cannot see the mouse and sometimes it is difficult to "touch" at the</p>
            <p>right thing that I want to click on.</p>
            
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>One adventage I like about the small screen is that my eyeballs don't need to look</p>
            <p>around in order to find the button or whatever information that I need. I bet </p>
            <p>that everyone had encounter this problem before when they want to find something from the</p>
            <p>big srceen, they looked all over the screen and still cannot find the login button.</p>
            <p>Another thing I like aobut the small screen is that it is so much simpler that they</p>
            <p>hide most of the unnecessary imformations and ads I don't really need for my life.</p>

            <p>What did you learn? Where there any surprises?</p>
            
            
            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.
