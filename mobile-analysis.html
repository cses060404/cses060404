            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the task, we were asked to use our mobile devices to browse for 24 hours instead of using</p>
            <p>desktop or laptop. The purpose of this task is to help us having a better understanding of </p>
            <p>how it is like to browser in a tiny screen for a long time. I was able to pay more attention</p> 
            <p>on the sites that I have always been browsing and I did have different feelings about those sites.</p>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>Here are some of the example questions to help us know how the experiment went. </p>
            
            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>I can still pretty much see all the information that I wanna to see. 
            However, for the website that I use the most -- BYUI I-Learn, I cannot see 
            the couse links but only the assignments. Sometimes I just want to view a 
            specific couse and the grade of it, without the tab, it's harder to gain 
            access to it.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>answer here</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>answer here</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>answer here</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>answer here</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>What did you learn? Where there any surprises?</p>
            
            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://byui.brightspace.com" target="_blank">BYUI I-Learn</a></li>
